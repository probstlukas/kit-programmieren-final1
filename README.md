# kit-programmieren-final1
First final project for KIT Programmieren WS 2019/20, which is about a model railway simulation. It consists of two interdependent subtasks. The first subtask is the modeling of the railway network and the rolling stock (coaches, engines, train sets). The second subtask is the driving simulation.

The graphic representation of the rolling stock is partly based on the [sl program](https://github.com/mtoyoda/sl) by Toyoda Masashi.
